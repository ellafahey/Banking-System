First year C Programming Assignment. 

This assignment demonstrares the implementation of basic programming statements and functionalities to allow users to manage their PIN on an ATM. When the program is run, the user is displayed with a menu providing them with a choice to enter and verify their PIN, change their PIN, display the number of times their PIN was entered successfully and incorrectly and finally to exit the program.

I received a grade of 99% for this assignment.
